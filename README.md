## Political Misinformation on Reddit

The problem of online misinformation is one that has not only majorly dictated the public sentiment of certain political figures and events, but has also sowed a general distrust of political authority in most of the American public, leading to changes in outcomes of major elections and more.

[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/), which is one of the largest American social platforms, has had a number of known incidents regarding misinformation, including the banning of numerous controversial subreddits.

### Introduction

In this project, we investigate the dissemination and characterization of misinformation spread on the online discussion site Reddit, looking specifically at a large subset of randomly selected American political subreddits using the Reddit API.

By taking advantage of Reddit’s hierarchical structure of subreddits, moderators, users, posts, and comments, we hope to replicate the investigation on the spread of misinformation on Twitter (from Q1) with a similar investigation on the spread of political misinformation on Reddit in the years 2020 and 2021.

We address questions such as the following:

```markdown
- To what extent do (American) political boards/forums/subreddits on Reddit share misinformation?
- Is there any notable difference in the k-core decomposition of Reddit vs. Twitter?
- Is there any significant difference across subreddits in the type of political misinformation being spread?
- Are there individual users that commonly spread political misinformation across all subreddits?
```

### Jekyll Themes
